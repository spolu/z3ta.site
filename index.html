      <h1>z3ta: towards safer systems design</h1>

      <p>
      z3ta's mission is to ease and extend the use of program and design
      verification to help engineers build safer systems.
      </p>

      <p>
      We believe there is a strong latent need for program verification in tech
      companies, in particular infrastructural companies seeking very high
      levels of reliability. These companies are today structurally incapable
      of achieving more than 99.99% of reliability because the development
      tools popular in this decade (type-checking, unit and functional testing)
      do not provide the guarantees needed to achieve higher levels of
      reliability at scale (1000s of engineers collaborating on a single
      codebase).
